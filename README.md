<h2> üåé Overview </h2>

<p> The H&M KPI Dashboard is a web-based application that presents a comprehensive overview of various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using real datasets from H&M. Especifically, the data is based on customers, articles, and transactions data. By employing a cloud-based architecture, the application fetches, filters, and displays KPI data in <b>real-time</b>.<p>

The project is built from four components:

1. A frontend built with Streamlit, which allows users to register and login, but most importantly to view and manipulate data visualizations regarding the customers, articles, and transactions data. Additionally, there is a .streamlit config folder which personalizes the theme of the application.
2. A backend API built with Flask, which handles user authentication and serves data to the frontend from the database in JSON format via HTTP GET requests.
3. Google Cloud SQL-based MySQL database with four tables: customers, articles, transactions, and users (containing the credentials for login information).
4. User authentication and registration, which stores user information in the users table within database and verifies credentials during login.

Both the frontend and backend are hosted on Google App Engine, ensuring a seamless link between the two components. To reduce loading times, the application limits the number of rows retrieved to 1000 rows each. 

<p><b>Please beware</b> that the link doesn't apply the registration and login. However, by running the application locally, the code does include this two features.<p>

<h2> üíª Technology Stack </h2>

Python, SQL, Flask, Streamlit, Pandas, Google App Engine, MySQL.


<h2> üìä Datasets </h2>

The datasets consist of data related with Customers, Transactions, and Articles. Each of the datasets contain their own columns, briefly explained below:

1. **Customers dataset** featuring customer_id, FN, Active, club_member_status, fashion_news_frequency, age, and postal_code.

2. **Articles dataset** featuring article_id, product_code, prod_name, product_type_name, colour_group_name, department_name, index_group_name, and section_name.

3.  **Transactions dataset** featuring t_dat, customer_id, article_id, price, and sales_channel_id.


<h2>Security</h2>

For a secure connection between frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side), API keys are used. Functionality comes from the frontend sending the API key in the authorization header whenever making requests to the backend. The backend then verifies the API key before processing the request.


<h2> üèÉ How to Run the Project Locally</h2>

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/adrianmarino19/HM-analytics.git
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages for both frontend and backend:

```
cd frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Flask API:

```
cd backend
python api.py
```

5. In another terminal, run the Streamlit front-end:

```
cd frontend
streamlit run main.py
```
